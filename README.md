## Our Own Version Of Simple Shell

# Simple Shell Project (0x16)
This is a group project for the ALX software engineering internship. The project aims to create a simple UNIX command interpreter (shell) in the C programming language.

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a basic shell that can execute simple UNIX commands. The shell should display a prompt, accept user commands, execute them, and handle basic features like arguments, PATH, built-in commands, and logical operators.

# How to Use
To compile the shell, use the following command:

~~~bash  
  git clone https://github.com/rodynaamrfathy/simple_shell.git
~~~

Go to the project directory  

~~~bash  
  cd simple_shell
~~~

Compilation  

~~~bash  
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o shell
~~~

Start the app 

~~~bash  
./shell
~~~  

Project Tasks
The project is divided into multiple tasks, each building upon the previous ones. Tasks include implementing features like handling arguments, built-in commands, and logical operators.

passes the Betty checks.
 a basic UNIX command line interpreter.
Display a prompt, wait for user input, and execute simple commands.

Implement the env built-in command to print the current environment.
Write your own getline function without using the getline function.
Handle arguments without using strtok.
Handle arguments for the exit built-in command.
Implement the setenv and unsetenv built-in commands.
Implement the cd built-in command to change the current directory.
Handle the command separator ;.
Handle the logical operators && and ||.
